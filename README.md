# bratify

Simple iMessage extension to make a fake album cover in the "brat" format of black text on green. Input text and it shows a dynamic preview, and then automatically populates the message with the image for immediate sharing.

Inspired by several memes going around during summer 2024, especially one where the sender is in a very serious conversation but only talking through edits of the album cover. This extension provides the easiest possible way to achieve this in your conversations; no app switching is needed at all.

Open sourced because my Apple Developer portal is broken and the brat summer is ending.
